# Pneumonia Detection using CNN

This repository contains code for training and evaluating a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images.

## Overview

Pneumonia is a lung infection that causes inflammation in the air sacs, or alveoli, of one or both lungs. The infection can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
cd your_repository

### Step 2: Create and Activate a Conda Environment (Optional but Recommended)

If you prefer using Conda for managing environments, you can create a new Conda environment:

conda create --name pneumonia-env python=3.8
conda activate pneumonia-env

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Install the required packages using `pip` and the `requirements.txt` file provided:

pip install -r requirements.txt

This command will install all the necessary dependencies, including TensorFlow and other libraries required for the project.

### Step 4: Run the Project
